## @Autowired Injection
### Avoid field and setter injection
It should be used only for optional dependencies or in test code.

_Good_
- easy to use

_Bad_
- the bean can be changed runtime with a new call of the setter;
- the field can reference a null instance, you should add the annotation @Required to enforce the dependency;
- it's easy to add dependencies, the class risk to violate the single responsibility principle becoming a container of services.

### Use constructor injection

_Good_
- the beans cannot be null;
- the object is immutable;
- the object can be defined final;
- in case the bean has only one constructor you can omit [@Autowired](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-autowired-annotation
);
- force to better think the responsibility of the class.

## Avoid the use of @Value in Spring Boot

Spring Boot introduced the @ConfigurationProperties annotation that is 'far more superior than the basic @Value approach' according to St√©phane Nicoll (Pivotal).

The advantages:
- You inject only an object a POJO and not a list of fields
- There is less risk to do typos in the declaration of the property
- The POJO is TypeSafe and can contain complex structures (e.g. 'database.configuration.mysql.connection') 

Here you can find the documentation:
