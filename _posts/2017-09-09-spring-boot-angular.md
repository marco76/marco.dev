# Quick start your new Angular 5 (beta) / Spring Boot 2 (beta) project

This is a simple bootstrap for a web application based on Angular 5 (beta), Spring Boot 2 (beta), Angular Material.

The application gives you a structure to start a new project with a simple REST service called from the frontend.

Some features:

- support for Angular CLI.
- Swagger UI installed

 In the future I will simply fix the configuration and update the dependencies.
 No feature will be added.

## Build and run the project

You can find the project here:

https://github.com/marco76/spring-angular-material

to run it
 
```
git clone https://github.com/marco76/spring-angular-material
cd ./spring-angular-material mvn package
java -jar ./target/ng-spring-full-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war

You can access the application on http://localhost:8080
```

## Build and run in development
 
During the development you have to start the frontend and the backend separately.
 
The frontend runs on node.js, you can start with `ng serve`: http://localhost:4200
The frontend runs on Tomcat embedded: http://localhost:8080
