Two tips for the people who is fighting with these technologies:

1. Implement the login page: [here](http://ocpsoft.com/java/acegi-spring-security-jsf-login-page/) you have a great tutorial that explains how to implement a login page in JSF using Spring Security in only few lines of code. 

2. Somebody is implementing the tags for jsf. You can try his library : [BodyGuard](http://faces.eti.br/2008/11/09/bodyguard-facelets-el-functions-for-spring-security/)
