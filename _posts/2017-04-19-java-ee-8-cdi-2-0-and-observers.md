### Observable Event example with CDI 2.0 (Java EE 8)

Code source: [GitHub](https://github.com/marco76/java-demo/tree/master/server/src/main/java/io/javademo/examples/cdi/event)

  * CDI website: <https://www.cdi-spec.org/>
  * CDI documentation: <https://docs.jboss.org/cdi/spec/2.0-PFD2/cdi-spec.html>
  * CDI specifications: [https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=365](https://docs.jboss.org/cdi/spec/2.0-PFD2/cdi-spec.html)

With Java EE 8 CDI will receive a major upgrade. Between the [new major features](https://docs.jboss.org/cdi/spec/2.0-PFD2/cdi-spec.html#_major_changes) we can find:

  * Observer ordering
  * Asynchronous event

In this demo we will build a small example using these new features. You can find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/marco76/java-demo/tree/master/server/src/main/java/io/javademo/examples/cdi/event).

### Weather station : requirements

[<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/uploads/2017/04/weather.png?resize=402%2C253" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1127" data-recalc-dims="1" />]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/uploads/2017/04/weather.png)

In this example we simulate a **Weather station** that has to notify multiple observer every time the weather changes.

There are 3 clients (Observers):

* The TV channel that want to be alerted for every change. The communication has to be done **immediately** via a predefined channel and **when possible (best effort)** a detailed report has to be sent via mail (preparing a mail requires time (blocking activity).
* The official Weather website has to be updated immediately, it doesn&#8217;t need a detailed report (more twitter style communication).
* The emergency services of the government need to be alerted only in case of catastrophic events (flood etc). The communication has to be immediate.

### Technical implementation

The clients are Observers that need to be notified when an event occours. The _TV Channel Observer_:

```java

@Stateless
public class TVChannelsChangeObserver {
    public void notifyTVChannel(@Observes WeatherEvent weatherEvent) {
       weatherEvent.addEvent("TV Channel informed about the " + weatherEvent.getCurrentWeather());
    }
    
    public void sendDetailedReport(@ObservesAsync WeatherEvent weatherEvent) {
        weatherEvent.addEvent("ASYNCH : TV Channel, detailed email report sent");
    }
}

```

The class has two methods: one annotated with **@Observes** receives the synchronous _WeatherEvent_ (notifyTVChannel), one annotated with **@ObservesAsynch** receives the async _WeatherEvent_.

WeatherEvent is a simple POJO that can be used to fire an Event.

``` java
public class WeatherEvent {
    private String currentWeather;

    public WeatherEvent(String currentWeather) {
        this.currentWeather = currentWeather;
    }
}

```

The Emergency Services have to be alerted only in case of &#8216;_emergency_&#8216;, in this case we can use a @Qualifier to filter the notification received:

``` java
public void sendAlarm(@Observes @WeatherType(value = "emergency") WeatherEvent weatherEvent) {
    weatherEvent.addEvent("EMERGENCY communication sent!!! They will come soon!");
}    

```

### How to fire the events

To fire the event we need to inject the _WeatherEvent_ 2 times in our service or controller class. One time for the sync Event, the second time for the async Event (with the _@Qualifier_ WeatherType).

``` java
@Inject
Event<WeatherEvent> weatherEvent;

@Inject
@WeatherType(value = "emergency")
Event<WeatherEvent> emergencyEvent;
```

If we receive an emergency alert we fire the Event of type &#8217;emergency&#8217; (emergencyEvent), otherwise we fire a simple &#8216;weatherEvent&#8217;.

``` java
WeatherEvent weatherSubject = new WeatherEvent(weatherRequestBean.getWeather());

if (weatherRequestBean.getEmergency()) {
    emergencyEvent.fire(weatherSubject);
    emergencyEvent.fireAsync(weatherSubject);
} else {
    weatherEvent.fire(weatherSubject);
    weatherEvent.fireAsync(weatherSubject);
}
```

The container automatically call the Observers interested:

* _emergencyEvent.fire(weatherSubject)_ : no Observer
* _emergencyEvent.fireAsync(weatherSubject)_ : EmergencyObserver, TVChannelObserver, WeatherWebsiteObserver
* _emergencyEvent.fire(weatherSubject)_ : TVChannelObserver, WeatherWebsiteObserver
* _emergencyEvent.fireAsync(weatherSubject)_ : TVChannelObserver

The advantage of this solution is that you can add new Observers (e.g. newspaper, Twitter etc.) without any change to the application logic.
