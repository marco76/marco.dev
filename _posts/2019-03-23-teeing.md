## Documentation

Java Documentation: [Collectors#teeing](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Collectors.html)

_Returns a Collector that is a composite of two downstream collectors. Every element passed to the resulting collector is processed by both downstream collectors, then their results are merged using the specified merge function into the final result._

Signature

`static <T,​R1,​R2,​R>
 Collector<T,​?,​R> teeing​(Collector<? super T,​?,​R1> downstream1, Collector<? super T,​?,​R2> downstream2, BiFunction<? super R1,​? super R2,​R> merger)`


## Fun facts

This is a tee:
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/uploads/2019/tee.jpg"/>

The etymology of teeing can help us to remember the name during our daily activity or to show our knowledge at the workplace.

Teeing is originated from the plumbing tee!

Wikipedia: _‘A tee, the most common pipe fitting, is used to combine (or divide) fluid flow.’_

Linux has the `tee` command that splits the data! Among the authors we find Richard Stallman.

Other names proposed for this feature:
bisecting, duplexing, bifurcate, replicator, fanout, tapping, unzipping, tapping, collectionToBothAndThen, biCollecting, expanding, forking, etc.

## Examples

I collected 3 different examples with different level of complexity.

You could statically `import static java.util.stream.Collectors.*;` to reduce the amount of written code.

### Guest List

We extract 2 different type of information from a list (stream) of objects.
Every guest has to accept the invitation and can come with the family.

We want to know who is going participate and the total number of participants.

```java
var result =
  Stream.of(
  // Guest(String name, boolean participating, Integer participantsNumber)
  new Guest("Marco", true, 3),
  new Guest("David", false, 2),
  new Guest("Roger",true, 6))
  .collect(Collectors.teeing(
    // first collector, we select only who confirmed the participation
    Collectors.filtering(Guest::isParticipating,
       // whe want to collect only the first name in a list
       Collectors.mapping(o -> o.name, Collectors.toList())),
       // second collector, we want the total number of participants
    Collectors.filtering(Guest::isParticipating,
        Collectors.summingInt(Guest::getParticipantsNumber)),
       // we merge the collectors in a new Object,
       // the values are implicitly passed
       EventParticipation::new
   ));

  System.out.println(result);
  
  // Result
  // EventParticipation { guests = [Marco, Roger],
  // total number of participants = 9 }

```

___Classes Used___

```java
class Guest {
  private String name;
  private boolean participating;
  private Integer participantsNumber;

  public Guest(String name, boolean participating,
   Integer participantsNumber) {
    this.name = name;
    this.participating = participating;
    this.participantsNumber = participantsNumber;
  }

  public boolean isParticipating() {
    return participating;
  }

  public Integer getParticipantsNumber() {
    return participantsNumber;
  }
}

class EventParticipation {
  private List<String> guestNameList;
  private Integer totalNumberOfParticipants;

  public EventParticipation(List<String> guestNameList,
   Integer totalNumberOfParticipants) {
    this.guestNameList = guestNameList;
    this.totalNumberOfParticipants = totalNumberOfParticipants;
}

@Override
public String toString() {
  return "EventParticipation { " +
    "guests = " + guestNameList +
    ", total number of participants = " + totalNumberOfParticipants +
    " }";
  }}
```

## Filter names in two different lists

In this example we split a stream of names in two lists according to a filter.

```java
var result =
  Stream.of("Devoxx", "Voxxed Days", "Code One", "Basel One",
     "Angular Connect")
  .collect(Collectors.teeing(
  // first collector
  Collectors.filtering(n -> n.contains("xx"), Collectors.toList()),
  // second collector
  Collectors.filtering(n -> n.endsWith("One"), Collectors.toList()),
  // merger - automatic type inference doesn't work here
  (List<String> list1, List<String> list2) -> List.of(list1, list2)
  ));

  System.out.println(result); // -> [[Devoxx, Voxxed Days], [Code One, Basel One]]
```

## Count and sum a stream of integers

Maybe you saw a similar example circulating on blogs giving merging sum and count to give the average.

That example doesn't require Teeing, you can use AverageInt and a simple collector.
 
The following use the features of Teeing returning the 2 values:

```java
var result =
  Stream.of(5, 12, 19, 21)
    .collect(Collectors.teeing(
      // first collector
      Collectors.counting(),
      // second collector
      Collectors.summingInt(n -> Integer.valueOf(n.toString())),
      // merger: (count, sum) -> new Result(count, sum);
      Result::new
  ));

  System.out.println(result); // -> {count=4, sum=57}
```

The Result class

```java
class Result {
  private Long count;
  private Integer sum;

  public Result(Long count, Integer sum) {
    this.count = count;
    this.sum = sum;
  }
  
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return "{" +
      "count=" + count +
      ", sum=" + sum +
    '}';
  }}
```

## Pitfalls
### Map.Entry
Many examples use Map.Entry to store the result of the BiFunction.

Please don't do this, because you are not storing a Map. Java Core doesn't have a standard object to store 2 values, you have to create it by yourself.

Pair in Apache Utils uses Map.Entry, for this reason is not a valid alternative.
