To know what's included in this release: [http://java-version.com/java/15](http://java-version.com/java/15)

### Install Java 15 using SDKMAN!

To quickly install Java releases and switch between them I use SDKMAN!, you can see more details here: [https://marco.dev/java-angular-setup](https://marco.dev/java-angular-setup).

We are going to install AdoptOpenJDK, this JDK is free and supported by the community (RedHat).

For Java 15 you can execute the following command:

```bash
sdk install java 15.0.1.hs-adpt
```

Here the video of the install:
