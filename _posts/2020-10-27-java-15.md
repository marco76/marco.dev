Official [JEP 360](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/360)

The documentation of Oracle is pretty good, you can find it here:
[Java SE Language Updates - Sealed classes](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/language/sealed-classes-and-interfaces.html)

For a deep dive you can read this document of Brian Goetz:
[Data Classes and Sealed Types for Java](https://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/amber/datum.html)


### Install Java 15 using SDKMAN!

To quickly install Java releases and switch between them I use SDKMAN!, you can see more details here: [https://marco.dev/java-angular-setup](https://marco.dev/java-angular-setup).

We are going to install AdoptOpenJDK, this JDK is free and supported by the community (RedHat).

For Java 15 you can execute the following command:

```bash
sdk install java 15.0.1.hs-adpt
```

Here the video of the install:
