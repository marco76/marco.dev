introduction: 'Java 15 new features'
---
To know what's included in this release: [http://java-version.com/java/15](http://java-version.com/java/15)

## In 2 minutes
Java 15 is not a Long Term Support version and will be supported until 16th March 2021 (estimated date). There are a lot of _preview features_ and some _cleanup_.

The main impact for the developers is the introduction of **Text Blocs**.

For DevOps it's very important the introduction of 2 new Garbage Collectors: **Shenandoah** and **Z**.
If you have big applications in the cloud that require a lot of RAM and processing, the new GCs are worth a try that could save you money.


## Features that could change your daily work!

### Text Blocks (Production)

Text blocks was initially planned for Java 12 but this feature generated a lot of debates inside the Java Community and it's introduction has been postponed.
After being in _preview_ in JDK 13 and 14 it's the Prime Time for Text Blocks.
It's now an official feature of Java.

Official [JEP 378](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/378)
Oracle's [Programmer's Guide to Text Blocks](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/text-blocks/index.html)

### ZGC: A Scalable Low-Latency Garbage Collector (Production)

The new shiny Garbage Collector of Oracle goes in production. You can give it a try using `-XX:+UseZGC`.

Big competitor in this space is Shenandoah developed by RedHat.

The default garbage collector is still G1 (since Java 9).

If you want to learn more about Garbage Collectors you can find a 10 minutes intro here: [marco.dev GC](https://marco.dev/garbage-collectors-intro)

Official [JEP 377](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/377)

### Shenandoah: A Low-Pause-Time Garbage Collector (Production)

The new super powerful GC developed by RedHat. You can give it a try using `-XX:+UseShenandoahGC`.

If you want to learn more about Garbage Collectors you can find a 10 minutes intro here: [marco.dev GC](https://marco.dev/garbage-collectors-intro)

## Features that will impact your development but are not ready yet!

### Sealed classes (Preview)

Quick intro and example: 
[https://marco.dev/java-sealed-classes](https://marco.dev/java-sealed-classes).

Official [JEP 360](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/360)

The documentation of Oracle is pretty good, you can find it here:
[Java SE Language Updates - Sealed classes](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/language/sealed-classes-and-interfaces.html)

For a deep dive you can read this document of Brian Goetz:
[Data Classes and Sealed Types for Java](https://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/amber/datum.html)

### Pattern Matching for instanceof (Second Preview)

Official [JEP 375](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/375)

For a deep dive you can read this document of Brian Goetz:
[Pattern Matching for Java](https://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/amber/pattern-match.html)


Oracle [documentation and examples] (https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/language/pattern-matching-instanceof-operator.html)


### Records (Second Preview)

Excellent ;-) quick intro: [Java Records](https://marco.dev/java-records)

Official [JEP 384](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/384)

From the official JEP:
> Enhance the Java programming language with records, which are classes that act as transparent carriers for immutable data. Records can be thought of as nominal tuples.

- [Hidden Classes](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/371)
- [Remove the Nashorn JavaScript Engine](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/372)
- [Reimplement the Legacy DatagramSocket API](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/373)
- [Disable and Deprecate Biased Locking](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/374)

### Install Java 15 using SDKMAN!

To quickly install Java releases and switch between them I use SDKMAN!, you can see more details here: [https://marco.dev/java-angular-setup](https://marco.dev/java-angular-setup).

We are going to install AdoptOpenJDK, this JDK is free and supported by the community (RedHat).

For Java 15 you can execute the following command:

```bash
sdk install java 15.0.1.hs-adpt
```

Here the video of the install:
