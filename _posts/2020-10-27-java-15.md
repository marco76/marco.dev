introduction: 'Java 15 new features'
---
To know what's included in this release: [http://java-version.com/java/15](http://java-version.com/java/15)

How to test the preview features: [https://marco.dev/java-test-preview-features](How to test preview features)

## In 2 minutes
Java 15 is not a Long Term Support version and will be supported until 16th March 2021 (estimated date). There are a lot of _preview features_ and some _cleanup_.

The main impact for the developers is the introduction of **Text Blocs**.

For DevOps it's very important the introduction of 2 new Garbage Collectors: **Shenandoah** and **Z**.
If you have big applications in the cloud that require a lot of RAM and processing, the new GCs are worth a try that could save you money.


## Features that could change your daily work!

### Text Blocks (Production)

Text blocks were initially planned for Java 12 but this feature generated a lot of debates inside the Java Community and it's introduction has been postponed.
After being in _preview_ in JDK 13 and 14 it's the Prime Time for Text Blocks.
It's now an official feature of Java.

A nice ;) post here, with examples: [Text Blocks examples](https://marco.dev/java-text-blocks)

Official [JEP 378](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/378)
Oracle's [Programmer's Guide to Text Blocks](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/text-blocks/index.html)

In few words _Text blocks_ support multi-line string through a new delimiter `"""`.

Here an example:
```java
String java14 = "I like this Blog.\nIt show me some examples\nin Java and Angular!";

String java15 = """
        I like this Blog.
        It show me some examples
        in Java and Angular!""";

java14.equals(java15) // => true
```

In its current state this feature is pretty limited compared to _string literals_ offered by other languages. 

### ZGC: A Scalable Low-Latency Garbage Collector (Production)

The new shiny Garbage Collector of Oracle goes in production. You can give it a try using `-XX:+UseZGC`.

Big competitor in this space is Shenandoah developed by RedHat.

The default garbage collector is still G1 (since Java 9).

If you want to learn more about Garbage Collectors you can find a 10 minutes intro here: [marco.dev GC](https://marco.dev/garbage-collectors-intro)

Official [JEP 377](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/377)

### Shenandoah: A Low-Pause-Time Garbage Collector (Production)

The new super powerful GC developed by RedHat. You can give it a try using `-XX:+UseShenandoahGC`.

You can find on InfoQ an interesting interview with Shenandoah's RedHat Team: [Shenandoah in JDK 11 - Interview with Red Hat's Team](https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/10/shenandoah-interview/)

For your info: if you want to use Shenandoah in production without waiting for Java 15, you can already it from JDK 8 if you are using a RedHat distribution (RH Linux, OpenShift).

## Features that will impact your development but are not ready yet!

### Sealed classes (Preview)

Quick intro and example: 
[https://marco.dev/java-sealed-classes](https://marco.dev/java-sealed-classes).

Official [JEP 360](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/360)

The documentation of Oracle is pretty good, you can find it here:
[Java SE Language Updates - Sealed classes](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/language/sealed-classes-and-interfaces.html)

For a deep dive you can read this document of Brian Goetz:
[Data Classes and Sealed Types for Java](https://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/amber/datum.html)

### Pattern Matching for instanceof (Second Preview)

Official [JEP 375](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/375)

For a deep dive you can read this document of Brian Goetz:
[Pattern Matching for Java](https://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/amber/pattern-match.html)


Oracle [documentation and examples] (https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/language/pattern-matching-instanceof-operator.html)


### Records (Second Preview)

Excellent ;-) quick intro: [Java Records](https://marco.dev/java-records)

Official [JEP 384](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/384)

From the official JEP:
> Enhance the Java programming language with records, which are classes that act as transparent carriers for immutable data. Records can be thought of as nominal tuples.

Oracle [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/language/records.html)

### Changes that probably won't impact your work

- [Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/339)
- [Hidden Classes](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/371)
- [Remove the Nashorn JavaScript Engine](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/372)
- [Reimplement the Legacy DatagramSocket API](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/373)
- [Disable and Deprecate Biased Locking](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/374)
- [Remove the Solaris and SPARC Ports](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/381)
- [Foreign-Memory Access API (Second Incubator)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/383)
- [Deprecate RMI Activation for Removal] (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/385)

### Install Java 15 using SDKMAN!

To quickly install Java releases and switch between them I use SDKMAN!, you can see more details here: [https://marco.dev/java-angular-setup](https://marco.dev/java-angular-setup).

We are going to install AdoptOpenJDK, this JDK is free and supported by the community (RedHat).

For Java 15 you can execute the following command:

```bash
sdk install java 15.0.1.hs-adpt
```

Here the video of the install:
