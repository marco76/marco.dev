### prepare and compile
You have to create a java class that contains a main method:
 
 `public static void main(String[] args)`
 

You need to compile your class to execute it:

`javac YourMainClass.java`

This command generates a YourMainClass.class file that can be executed.

### run the java class

`java YourMainClass`

The Java Runtime should be installed and accessible from your terminal.
