As you know the IDE is usually a subject of ‘religious’ debate and we want to avoid it. For Java and Angular development you can use any text editor to create the code but here we try to list IDE built to ease the development.
  
Usually is your employer or client that decide the tool you have to use and you cannot anything to change his mind.

Here a list of tools that are useful for your Java and Angular development.

**JAVA**

For Java the 3 leaders are very well known. The best is ‘a matter of preference’.

  * <a href="https://netbeans.org/" target="_blank">Netbeans</a> : excellent tool and very innovative. Free and, soon, open source.
  * <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/home/index.php" target="_blank">Eclipse</a> : used by most of the companies / developers. Free and Open source.
  * <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/?fromMenu" target="_blank">IntelliJ IDEA</a>  : preferred by independent consultants and small companies. Very high quality environment. Free and commercial license.

**Angular**

  * <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/?fromMenu" target="_blank">WebStorm</a>: Angular and Typescript come out of the box. One of the leader for the web development. Created by JetBrains, the same company that produces Intellij. Great value added if used in combination with Intellij. Commercial license.
  * <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>: excellent product with built in support for JavaScript and TypeScript. Free and open source.
  * <a href="https://brackets.io/" target="_blank">Brackets.io</a>: rising star IDE for the web development. You need to install plugins for Angular. Open source.
  * <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a>: excellent IDE for web development. You need to install plugins for Angular. Free and commercial license.
  * <a href="https://netbeans.org/" target="_blank">Netbeans</a>: the Netbeans team invested a lot of energies to extend his Java IDE to the web. Angular doesn’t come out of the box. A plugin is required.
  * <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/home/index.php" target="_blank">Eclipse</a>: eclipse depends a lot from his plugins universe and volunteers that use their time to extend the platform. There are some plugins that can help you for the web development but I’d suggest to look at other tools.

&nbsp;

For this website we will use a combination of tools (trying to compare them) with a preference for free and open source tools.
  
We will try to use mainly **Netbeans** for Java and **Visual Studio Code** for Angular.
  
If I had the choice, in a professional environment, I’d choose **IntelliJ IDEA** (and WebStorm).
