### Install Java 16 using SDKMAN!

To quickly install Java releases and switch between them I use SDKMAN!, you can see more details here: [https://marco.dev/java-angular-setup](https://marco.dev/java-angular-setup).

We are going to install OpenJDK, this is the 'official version' used for the development of the JDK.

For Java 16 you can execute the following command:

```bash
sdk install java -version 16.ea.21-open
```

Here the video of the install:
