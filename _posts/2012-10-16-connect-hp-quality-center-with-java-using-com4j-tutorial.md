I try to add some new information about how to connect to Quality Center using Java.

I will complete a step by step tutorial from the creation of the basic classes to the querying of the bugs.

In this first tutorial I show how to create the classes needed to connect your program to QC using the OtaClient.dll. OtaClient is not a java library and cannot used directly by our program, we need to create a wrapper that translate our request to a native language. To do this the fastest method is to use Com4j

**1. Find the OtaClient.dll**

You should find the OtaClient.dll in the following folder:

c:Program Files (x86)Common FilesMercuryInteractiveQuality Center

If you cannot find the library try to use the search features of Windows. This library is required to communicate to the server.

**2. Download com4j**

<https://java.net/projects/com4j/downloads>

When you downloaded the library you have to unzip it. As example I unzipped it in the dev folder.

**3. Use com4j to generate a library with the wrapped classes**

Because com4j is not compatible with 64 bit systems, use a 32 bit JRE or you will get:

Execute the tblimp.jar with a 32-bit JRE, you can use the following parameters:

-o is for the destination directory

-p is for the java package of destination

You could have few warning:

but at the end you should have your the sources ready under hpqc/com/qc:

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-186" title="qc_java" alt="" src="https://molteni.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/qc_java.png?resize=324%2C638" data-recalc-dims="1" />](https://molteni.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/qc_java.png?resize=324%2C638)

You can import these sources to connect and use QC from your application.
